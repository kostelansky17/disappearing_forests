            <!-- Forests provide many important goods and services — for example, they filter water, regulate climate, provide habitat for animal species, ..., etc. <strong class="text-white"> However, the forest coverage nowadays is sharply decreasing.</strong> Even worse, we could often read the news about deforestation including logging, wildfire and other natural disasters, rapidly shrinking our forest areas.<br>
            In this story, our aim is to analyze deforestation based on our given dataset, trying to link it to the food production (grazing of livestock and farming), commodities manufacture by means of lumber and minerals extracted from the deforested areas. Moreover, we will investigate the deforestation rate during the last decade in different geographical regions, finding the trend in each country. Lastly, by our thorough analysis, we will try to put forth possible methods for alleviating deforestation. -->

              almost 99% of country land is covered by trees. In countries like Russia and Brazil the overall percentage is lower,
              but their extension is so big that they account for a great part of world forests.

              Wood products are integral part of our daily lives.
              Demand has never been this big and <b>overall wood production</b>, accounting for different wood dervied products,
              has <b>increased by more than a billion cubic meters in the past twenty years</b>.
              This amount matches the total production of USA 2015.
              What scares the most is the fact that the trend does not seem to stop:
              growth is steady, and the only significant fact which was able to affect
              the wood production in the world was the economic crisis in 2007-2009.

              The leading continent in generating products from wood is Asia,

              In practice: the amount of <b>forest products appear to be correlated to shrinkage of forest areas in some regions</b>,

              a rough aggregated perspective at the level of continents is sufficient to get an idea of the phenomenon at global scale.
              A twenty year differential value (1995-2015) clearly shows how <strong>South America and Africa heavily decreased forest land in favour of wider croplands</strong>,

                Chile is an atypical example in the south american context.
                Given that agricultural production is based on fruits, with particular developement of grapes farming in the last decades,

            <strong>The agricultural style of a country is often linked to the effort
              of preserving and expanding tree covered areas</strong>.
            Indeed, analysing the 20 countries that had the biggest differential in forest land between 1990 and 2015
            (10 deforesting and 10 increasing their forest land) interesting similarities can be observed.
            <font color="#1f77b4">China</font>, which has the highest positive impact on reforestation all over the world,
            shares many agrarian products with european nations
            (<font color="#1f77b4">France</font>, <font color="#1f77b4">Spain</font>, <font color="#1f77b4">Italy</font>) that are also expanding forested areas;
            similar agricultural organization and ecological policy can be found in <font color="#1f77b4">Chile</font>,
            despite being it geographically closer to
            <font color="#ff7f0e">Argentina</font>, <font color="#ff7f0e">Bolivia</font>, <font color="#ff7f0e">Brazil</font> and <font color="#ff7f0e">Colombia</font>.
            Interesting facts are that <font color="#ff7f0e">Zimbabwe</font> has farming style particularly similar to the last three aforementioned countries.
            African nations in general cultivate different products.
            In the Middle East area <font color="#1f77b4">Thailand</font> has, from the farming perspective,
            a profile much closer to deforesting countries, even if it has a positive forest land differential:
            there, sugarcane accounts for one third of the total agricultural production, similarly to what happens in South America.
            <font color="#ff7f0e">Myanmar</font> and <font color="#1f77b4">Vietnam</font>
            are very close from the agricultural point of view but far for what concerns foresting policies;
            <font color="#ff7f0e">Indonesia</font> has a unique farming style.

              <b>Primary forests</b> are forests that exist in their original state and no human activity has ever had influence on.
              <b>Planted forests</b>, as name suggests, are trees established by deliberate seeding.
              Other forests are the ones not classified as either primary of planted.
              For example, naturally regenerated forests over areas where
              human activities (logging, agriculture) had taken place in the past
              are in this category.

            Main <b>factors for forest expansion vary a lot among countries.</b>
            For <b>USA and Russia, natural regeneration of primary forests</b> contribute to
            gain additional forested areas.
            In the United States, ten percent of total forest land is preserved as reserved forest
            and no timber harvesting is allowed in the land by law as written in
            <a href="https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/library/brochures/docs/2012/ForestFacts_1952-2012_English.pdf">
              <strong>the report of USDA, U.S. Forest Resource Facts and Historical Trends.</strong>
            </a>
            The figures in the report shows that reserved forests had expanded
            by twenty two million acres (nine million hectares) between 1997 and 2012.
            The national policy for forest reservation has been producing good result.

             has been investigating forest cover area in Russia since Soviet Era

            Russia suffers from massive wildfire almost every year.
            Siberian wildfire in 2019 is just one of the most striking examples.
            The fact that Russia managed to expand its forest land despite the periodical huge losses due to wildfires
            is a remarkable fact.
            <b>Looking at China and India, there is no doubt that tree planting is the major cause of reforestation.</b>
            Surprising thing is the fact that even if both countries are facing significant population growth
            and coping with needs for additional housings, infrastructure, food, and products,
            they have achived success in reforestation.

              China is the biggest contributor for reforestation in the world.

              Regenerated forests appear to have replaced areas including barren lands such as desert.
              China gained additional forest areas without loosing areas for agriculture,

                Forests are an incredibly valuable resource for humanity but their care is often not considered as a priority nowadays.
                Many countries keep diminishing their forest land without caring of the global scale effects this behavior can have.
                Luckily, encouraged by intervention of the scientific community, many solutions have been proposed:
                in the last two decades some countries have succesfully applied them,
                partially compensating the still huge amount of tree cut every year.
                In general, linking deforestation even to a single cause is a very tough challenge, but clear correlations
                can be shown in some restricted areas and enviromental circumstances. Wood production and trade can trigger it whenever
                developing countries are concerned and specific agricultural style are often linked to a higher need of cultivable land.
                The most useful thing that can be done to learn how to stop deforestation is look at positive examples:
                some countries, like China and India, managed to obtain good results in reforestation by applying strict regulations and
                discouraging illegal and dangerous uncontrolled forest destruction.
