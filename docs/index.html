            In this story, our aim is to analyze deforestation based on our given dataset, trying to link it to the food production (grazing of livestock and farming), commodities manufacture by means of lumber and minerals extracted from the deforested areas. Moreover, we will investigate the deforestation rate during the last decade in different geographical regions, finding the trend in each country. Lastly, by our thorough analysis, we will try to put forth possible methods for alleviating deforestation. -->

The forests contain share of Co2 on our planet and with every sawn tree this number decreases. The leading continent in production primary forest products have been in Asia followed by Northern America nad Europe, but the impact of wood production on defrestation is clearest in South America and Africa. In these two continents has the production increased by almost 30 percent, but the area of forested areas decreased by 7, respectively 6 percent.</p>

These countires tends to have highier GDP and lower density of population, what allows them to increase the wood areas by planting new trees. This observtion it's not true for every country, we can see that the artificial planting of forest doesn't take a place in countries as Norway or Canada, even though their high GDP or net export. On the other hand, there are the countires with low GDP from Asia or Africa in which is the share of planted forrests. Many of these countires have high density of population, what in combination with the wealth of the country results in the fact that they don't have resources to regenerate forests destroyed by the wood production.</p>

              Yes. But not always. In general it is hard to exstablish sure causality relationships in such a complex context,

              a rough aggregated perspective at the level of continents is sufficient to get an idea of the phenomenon at global scale.
              A twenty year differential value (1995-2015) clearly shows how <strong>South America and Africa heavily decreased forest land in favour of wider croplands</strong>,
              while in Europe an North America the opposite happened (even if at smaller scale).

          <h4>Do agricultural production influence forest policies?</h4>
          <p class="text-black mb-0">
            <strong>The agricultural style of a country is often linked to the effort
              of preserving and expanding tree covered areas</strong>.
            Indeed, analysing the 20 countries that had the biggest differential in forest land between 1990 and 2015
            (10 deforesting and 10 increasing their forest land) interesting similarities can be observed.
            <font color="#1f77b4">China</font>, which has the highest positive impact on reforestation all over the world,
            shares many agrarian products with european nations
            (<font color="#1f77b4">France</font>, <font color="#1f77b4">Spain</font>, <font color="#1f77b4">Italy</font>) that are also expanding forested areas;
            similar agricultural organization and ecological policy can be found in <font color="#1f77b4">Chile</font>,
            despite being it geographically closer to
            <font color="#ff7f0e">Argentina</font>, <font color="#ff7f0e">Bolivia</font>, <font color="#ff7f0e">Brazil</font> and <font color="#ff7f0e">Colombia</font>.
            Intresting facts are that <font color="#ff7f0e">Zimbabwe</font> has farming style particularly similar to the last three aforementioned countries.
            African noations in general does not cultivate similar different products.
            In the Middle East area <font color="#1f77b4">Thailand</font> has, from the farming perspective,
            a profile much closer to deforesting countries, even if it has a positive forest land differential:
            in this country sugarcane accounts for one third of the total agricultural production, similarly to what happens in South America.
            <font color="#ff7f0e">Myanmar</font> and <font color="#1f77b4">Vietnam</font>
            are very close from the agricultural point of view but far for what concerns foresting policies;
            <font color="#ff7f0e">Indonesia</font> has a unique farming style.

            <p class="text-black mb-0">
              Although the area of forest in the world shows decreasing trend,
              there certainly exists nations which have succeeded in
              expanding areas of forests in the land.
              The barchart indicates increase or decrase in forest area for each category
              in top 5 the most reforestationg countries for this two decades (1995-2015).
              The definition of the categories follows
              <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/ap862e/ap862e00.pdf">
                <strong>FAO's paper, FRA 2015 Terms and Definition </strong>

              .
              Primary forests are forests that exists in their original states and no human activities has influence on.
              Planted forests are trees established by deliberate seeding as its name suggests.
              Other forests means the forests that are not categoried as either primary of planted.
              For example, naturally regenerated forests over the areas that
              human activities such as logging and agriculture were taken place in the past
              are in this category.
              <b>We can observe from the chart that the most reforestating countries have made
              efforts on forest planting, however main factors for forest expansion varies among countries.</b>
              <b>For US and Russia, natural regenerations of primary forests contribute to
              gain additional forests areas in the land to some or large extent.</b>
              In the US, ten percent of total forest land is preserved as reserved forest
              and no timber harvesting is allowed in the land by law as written in
              <a href="https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/library/brochures/docs/2012/ForestFacts_1952-2012_English.pdf">
                <strong>the report of USDA, U.S. Forest Resource Facts and Historical Trends </strong>
              </a>
              . The figures in the report shows that reserved forests has expanted its ares
              by twenty two million acres (= nine million hectares) between 1997 and 2012.
              The national policy for forest reservation has been proucing good result for this decades in the view of reforestation.

               has been investigating forest cover area in Russia since its Soviet Era,
              and it also revealed the forest expansion in the land.
              Russia has been suffered from massive wildfire almost every year.
              Siberian wildfire in 2019 was fresh in our memory.
              The fact that Russia expands its forest land nevertheless the periodical huge lost of forests must be eye-opener for most people.
              <b>Looking at China and India, it is no doubt that tree planting is the major cause of reforestation.</b>
              Surprising thing is the fact that nevertheless both countries are facing with significant population grouwth
              and coping with needs for additional housings, infrastructure, food, and products,
              they have achived success in reforestation.
              In the following part of this section, we look into the effors of these two countries for forest protection and reforestation.

            <p class="text-black mb-0">
              China is the biggest countributer for reforestation in the world.
              Expansion of wooden areas in China accouts for more than forty percent of
              total reforested areas in the world in this two decades.
              <b>As we can see in the figure, China maintain its primary forests and countinuously expands both planted and other forest type areas.</b>
              Looking at land use, regenerated forest areas replace the areas categorized as other use including barren lands such as desert.
              It can be found out that China gains addional forest areas without loosing areas for agriculture,
              which are necessary for feeding the nation.

               The aim of this program is to mitigate and prevend floodind and soil erosion.
               In the program, farmers are paid for planting trees on their agricultural land and cultivating some barren lands instead.
               Reforestation in China has been brought by constant nation wide effors represented by these two program.

                Forests are an incredibly valuable resource for humanity but their care is often not considered as a priority nowadays.
                Many countries keep diminishing their forest land without caring of the global scale effects this behavior can have.
                Luckily, encouraged by intervention of the scientific community, many solution have been proposed:
                in the last two decades some countries have succesfully applied them,
                partially compensating the still huge amount of tree cut every year.
                In general, linking deforestation to a single or even multiple causes is a very tough challenge, but clear correlations
                can be shown in some restricted areas and enviromental circumstances. Wood production and trade can trigger it whenever
                poor countries are concerned and specific agricultual style are often linked to a higher need of cultivable land.
                The most useful thing that can be done to learn how to stop deforestation is look at positive examples:
                some countries, like China and India, managed to obtain good results in reforestation by applying strict regulations and
                discouraging illegal and dangerous uncontrolled forest destruction.
